# friendlyeval
A friendly interface to tidyeval for the casual dplyr user.

Provides an alternative auto-complete friendly interface to rlang that is more closely aligned with the task domain of a user 'programming with dplyr'. 

# TODO
The last thing is to provide the ability to replace friendlyeval functions with their rlang equivalents after protyping a solution. This will be done with an RStudio addin.
